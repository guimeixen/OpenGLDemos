/*
Transforms any string into a fixed-size 32 bit integer for
efficient identification purposes while keeping all the
human-readable advantages of strings. This is inspired
from the similar approach as described by Jason Gregory
in his book 'Game Engine Architecture'.

Strings require more memory, dynamic memory allocation and
are more expensive to compare than pure integers. Seeing
as any game/graphics related engine has heavy requirements
on those 3 mentioned points deciding on a proper unique
identification scheme is quite relevant.

We create a hash function named SID that does the string
to integer conversion. Note that hashing is relatively
expensive; it's best to hash a string to get its unique
and use the integer id for all further computations.
